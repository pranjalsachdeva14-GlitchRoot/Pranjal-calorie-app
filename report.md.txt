# Weather Data Visualizer – Report

## Introduction
This project analyzes real-world weather data and produces insights using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Dataset
The dataset contains:
- Date
- Temperature
- Rainfall
- Humidity

## Data Cleaning
- Missing values handled
- Dates converted to datetime
- Irrelevant columns removed

## Statistical Analysis
- Daily mean, min, max, std computed
- Monthly grouped analysis done using `resample`

## Visualizations
1. Daily temperature trend (line chart)
2. Monthly rainfall totals (bar chart)
3. Humidity vs Temperature (scatter plot)
4. Combined subplot figure

## Insights
- Temperature showed stable upward pattern
- Rainfall is irregular
- Higher humidity observed at lower temperatures

## Conclusion
The project successfully shows how weather patterns can be understood through Python-based data analysis.
